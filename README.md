# Reviewing sequence of 70+ passes made by Venezuela against Chile (Soccer)
## by Anthony Verdesca

The code helps to group of passes that lead to the third goal of Venezuela against Chile during the Conmebol Qualifications Match in 2024. 
Data was extracted making use of the tool made by FC Python.

We will answer the following questions:

1) Which side of the field Venezuela moved the ball/played the most.
2) We will check if every single player on the Venezuelan's men soccer team touched the ball during the creation of the third goal against Chile.

# Introduction
FC Python is a project that aims to provide accessible resources for learning basic Python, programming, and data skills to people interested in sports. It uses football data and concepts to deliver Python skills and tools.
The interfaces connects a Youtube video and the user can define Players names, Events and location on the field by clicking on the soccer and making its best educated guess.

Data was extracted using this [video](https://youtu.be/7dBx-xTlrl4)

# Methodology

The process consisted in 3 stages:
1) [Importing and Cleaning data](https://github.com/DatafromtheBleachers/ProjectVenezuelaChile/blob/main/Code/Project_VenezuelavsChile-Cleaning-Data.ipynb)
2) [Data Visualization using mplsoccer and heatmaps](https://github.com/DatafromtheBleachers/Understat/blob/main/Project-Understat.ipynb)

# Results

## 1) Which side of the field Venezuela moved the ball/played the most? ##

- Venezuela leaned more towards the left side of the field (Attacking from Left to Right), probably because Chile's player that got a red card was on that side of the field or also because Soteldo - the most skilled player in Venezuela - plays on the left wing.

Nonetheless, this does not show the exact path between each passing. A video will produce a better buildup:

## 2) Is every single player on the Venezuelan's men soccer team touching the ball during the creation of the third goal against Chile?

- The answer is clearly yes! and not only that, but some players get more than 10 passes
